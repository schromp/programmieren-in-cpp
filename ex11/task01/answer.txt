without any fixes:
  function returns the iterator that was used to insert.
  this iterator does not have the updated container values
  so when we set it in the pair it is wrong!

fixa:
  due to not being allowed to use the return value
  we have to walk through the container again and find the
  spot where we have inserted.

fixb:
  when using insert the return value is an updated iterator
  which includes the changes we have made to the container
