The output of the program is:
top = 1, bottom = 42
the for loop is overflowing the array

Input Commands:

break 13
run
watch s.bottom
continue
print i

Explanation:

Breakpoint at 13 so s.bottom is in scope
I setup the watchpoint at s.bottom to see when it is changing
when s.bottom got changed i looked at the line where it happened
i saw that it was in the for loop and printed i
i came to the conclusion that the for loop is overflowing 
and therefor writing into s.bottom
