cube1 allocates 96Bytes on my machine
this is the case because:
    int is 4byte big on my pc
    the last part of the array cube1[3][2] -> [4] <- allocates 4*4Bytes
    the middle part of the array cube1[3] -> [2] <- [4] allocates 2*16Bytes
    the last part of the array cube1 -> [3] <- [2][4] allocates 3*32Bytes

Therefor 96Bytes are being allocated on my machine but not all are being filled by the initialization of cube1
For example between the [0][][] is only being filled by {1,2,3,4}. -> Only 16Bytes out of the 96Bytes are being filled.
