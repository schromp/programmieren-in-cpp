Overriding the std library is not possible.
Therefor the only option is to overload the << operator
That means im rewriting the function that prints the characters in of the string
after << 

Because im overriding the << operator I have to reimplement the printing of the
given string

While reimplementing the function I can just add ---start--- and ---end--- to be printed
